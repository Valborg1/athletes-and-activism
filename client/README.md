# Athletes and Activism

This application uses the MERN model (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) to create an app that allows the user login to the website, search for an athlete h/she likes, saves that athlete to a database, allows the user to assign charites and causes to the athlete, and in the future will allow them to contribute to any charitable organizations that their athlete contributes to
